# HKUST-SupplyChain
HKUST Supply Chain is a Solidity smart contract,  which inherits from the Ownable contract from the OpenZeppelin library. The contract manages the lifecycle of items in the supply chain, including ordering, shipping, and delivery, as well as providing a loan mechanism for companies based on their order history. 

To test the smart contract, you can use a development environment like Remix IDE or Truffle. Here are the basic steps to get started:
Set up the environment: Install and configure your preferred development environment (e.g., Remix IDE, Truffle).
Compile the contract: Compile the HKUSTSupplyChain.sol contract using your development environment.
Deploy the contract: Deploy the compiled contract to a local or test blockchain network.
Interact with the contract: Use the development environment's interface to interact with the deployed contract and test its functionality, such as ordering items, approving and shipping items, applying for and paying back loans, and querying the contract's state.
